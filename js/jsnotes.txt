"NaN (Not-a-Number) is the only JavaScript value which is not equal to itself when comparing with any of the comparison operators"

Why?

Here's the short story...

2. JavaScript is single threaded ,synchronous language.
3. Everything in javascript happen inside exicution contex-

4. Hoisting in javascript --
   JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all 
   the declarations 
   at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, 
   it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and
   variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their 
   scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
    example:
      console.log(num);
      isValid(123)
      var num=10
      function isValid(){

      }

6. JS is simply a scripting language, adding functionality 
into your website. JSX is an addition to the JavaScript 
syntax which is a mixture of both HTML and JavaScript. 
Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the 
code easier to understand for users.
