when in object key and variable name is same so we can use like

obj={
    name,
    city
}
this is also know as shourthand

object disreucturing
obj={name:"sa",city:"xyz"}
{name: 'sa', city: 'xyz'}
let {name,city}=obj
if key not there in object and we are trying to  Destructuring it will give undefine
if we value of key is undefined then also we will get undefined


spread operator
shallow-copy= when we copy referenceof object to another object

create a copy
- JSON.parse(JSON.stringyfy(obj))
- spread operator  --- const obj1={...obj};
- custom logic

concate object
obj3={obj1,obj2,city:{"name":"paris"}}
////
obj4=Object.assign(obj1,obj2);
